React Components
===

There are too distinct component types in this application:

* Re-usable components, stored in `common/` folder, and
* Everything else that compose the application and not particularly reusable.

For the latter, some components are grouped by their purpose:

* `client/`: The client pane where transactions are composed and executed
* `options/`: The Options modal and its related components
* `palette/`: The right sidebar and its related components
